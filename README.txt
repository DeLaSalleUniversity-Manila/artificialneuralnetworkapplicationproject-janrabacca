	ann.m
	train.m
	predict.m

ann.m - contains the code for the simulated neural network.
train.m - contains the code for the training of the data.
predict.m - contains the test program used in predicting grades.


To use the predict.m, type in "predict([x,y,z])"

	wherein: x = Pre-requisite grade(ENGLCOM grade)
		 y = Timeslot(1,2 or 3)
		 z = CGPA

it should output a corresponding grade in terms of DLSU's grading system.
